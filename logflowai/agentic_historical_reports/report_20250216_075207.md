## Event 1
State keys: ['os_llm']
os_llm -> os_answer: Based on the function output, the probability of the error being related to Distributed Systems is approximately 4.04%, and the predicted class is 0, which indicates no error from Distributed Systems. Therefore, it is unlikely that the problem with your Mac is caused by Distributed Systems. It might be worth exploring other potential causes such as software updates, hardware issues, or other system configurations.

## Event 2
State keys: ['mobile_llm']
mobile_llm -> mobile_answer: Based on the function output, the probability of the error being related to Mobile Systems is extremely low, at approximately 7.76e-12, and the predicted class is 0, indicating no error from Mobile Systems. Therefore, it is unlikely that the strange error on your Mac is caused by Mobile Systems. You may want to explore other potential causes such as software updates, hardware issues, or third-party applications.

## Event 3
State keys: ['application_llm']
application_llm -> application_answer: Based on the function output, there is a probability of approximately 63.8% that the error you are experiencing is related to the Operating System. Given that the predicted class is 1, it suggests that the issue is likely stemming from the Operating System itself. It would be advisable to check for any recent updates or patches for your Mac's OS, as well as any known issues that might have been reported by other users.

## Event 4
State keys: ['orchestrator_combine']
orchestrator_combine -> final_answer: Based on the analysis from different perspectives, it is most likely that the strange error on your Mac is related to the Operating System, with a probability of approximately 63.8%. It is advisable to check for any recent updates or patches for your Mac's OS and look into any known issues reported by other users. The error is unlikely to be caused by Distributed Systems or Mobile Systems. Consider exploring other potential causes such as software updates, hardware issues, or third-party applications if the OS does not seem to be the issue.
